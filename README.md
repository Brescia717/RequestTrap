# RequestTrap
Request trap is an app that catches and logs requests made to ```/{path_of_your_choice}```,
which can be displayed on ```/{path_of_your_choice}/requests```.

Each request has a unique id and can be viewed
via ```/{path_of_your_choice}/requests/:id```.

Also, ```/{path_of_your_choice}/requests``` has live reloading. Therefore, if you
make an additional request to ```/{path_of_your_choice}```, it will be displayed in
real-time on the ```/{path_of_your_choice}/requests``` page.
